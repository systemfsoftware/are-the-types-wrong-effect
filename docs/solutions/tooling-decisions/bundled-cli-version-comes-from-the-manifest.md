# A bundled CLI derives its printed version from the manifest

## Problem

`attw --version` answered `1.1.1` while the CLI's own manifest said 4.1.0. The value came from a literal passed to `Command.runWith(attwCommand, { version })`, so the flag kept working, printed something plausible, and could not be tied to any release. Nothing downstream noticed: the e2e lane invoked `--version` and asserted only exit code 0.

## Mechanism

1. **A literal is a second source of truth.** The manifest already owns the version; a literal next to it drifts silently, because nothing fails when the two disagree. The failure is invisible to the compiler and to any test asserting only that the flag runs.
2. **The artifact ships without its inputs.** The published package lists only `dist` and `LICENSE` in `files`, and the nix derivation installs the bundled entry alone into the store, wrapping it with a pinned Node. A runtime read of the manifest would find no file in either install path, so the value must be a build-time constant.
3. **The compiler config named the wrong resolver.** The package extended the NodeNext library preset every other workspace package extends, but nothing resolves its imports through Node: tsdown inlines every non-`node:` import into one ESM file. A preset that models Node's resolver describes a resolver that never runs, and it demands an import attribute for the JSON import that the bundler does not need.

## Architectural Invariants

**A released value has exactly one owner.** A version, banner, or identifier a user can read derives from the manifest the release pipeline bumps; the artifact carries the value baked, never a hand-copied duplicate.

**A build-time constant replaces a runtime fetch when the artifact ships without its inputs.** Substituting the manifest into the bundle is what makes the single-file install paths work:

```
before: writeVersion('1.1.1')                     // second source of truth, drifts silently
after:  writeVersion(__ATTW_CLI_VERSION__)        // defined from package.json by tsdown and vitest
```

**No TypeScript program in the package imports `package.json`.** The first fix imported the manifest from source and let the bundler inline it. That broke the mutation gate: the stryker TypeScript checker rewrites every tsconfig without its `include` list (`systemfsoftware/stryker-js-effect#91`), so a JSON file listed there drops out of the project and the dry-run compile fails with TS6307 before any mutant runs. The CLI's tsdown and vitest configs now each read `package.json` from disk, decode it through an Effect Schema JSON codec, and `define` `__ATTW_CLI_VERSION__`; the `cliVersion` export declares the constant and reads it. The manifest is still the only owner, and both configs must define it or the build and tests fail on an undefined identifier.

**The resolver model in the compiler config must name the resolver that actually runs.** `tsc/*` presets describe a package Node resolves; `bundler/*` presets describe a package a bundler inlines. Choosing by repo precedent rather than by the consumer is how a package ends up typechecked against a resolver it never uses.

**Derivation is only correct if the build runs after the bump.** Ordering is the load-bearing part of the invariant, not the import: the release `version` job bumps manifests and commits, the `publish` job builds before publishing, and the package's own `prepack` rebuilds while packing. A manual publish against a stale `dist` is the remaining window, and `prepack` is what closes it.

**A regression test for a baked value asserts against the file the build read.** Asserting one baked copy against another passes in exactly the case that matters — when both drifted. The e2e lane reads the CLI manifest and compares the binary's output to it.

## Verification and Prevention

The e2e lane carries the assertion, because that lane already runs the published binary. It decodes the manifest rather than casting it — a manifest without a string version throws instead of making both comparison sides `undefined` — and derives both halves of the expected line, so the printed name is pinned to the published `bin` entry rather than repeated as a literal:

```ts
const cliManifest = async (url: URL): Promise<{ command: string; version: string }> => {
  const manifest: unknown = JSON.parse(await readFile(url, 'utf8'))
  if (
    typeof manifest !== 'object' || manifest === null ||
    !('version' in manifest) || typeof manifest.version !== 'string' ||
    !('bin' in manifest) || typeof manifest.bin !== 'object' || manifest.bin === null
  ) {
    throw new Error(`${url.pathname} declares no string version and bin entry`)
  }
  const commands = Object.keys(manifest.bin)
  const [command] = commands
  if (command === undefined || commands.length !== 1) {
    throw new Error(`${url.pathname} declares ${commands.length} bin entries; the printed name needs exactly one`)
  }
  return { command, version: manifest.version }
}

const { command, version } = await cliManifest(url)
expect(stripAnsi(result.stdout).trim()).toBe(`${command} v${version}`)
```

Decode the CLI's own JSON output the same way. Its payload has two shapes: a package that ships no types reports `{ analysis: { packageName, packageVersion, types: false } }` with neither `entrypoints` nor top-level `problems`, while a typed package adds both. A decoder that requires them throws on the untyped shape — validate against real output from both before shipping it.

Checks that held for this fix: `pnpm check:ci` exits 0; the tsdown bundle and the nix artifact both print `attw v4.1.0` (`.#attw`), where the pre-fix bundle printed `attw v1.1.1` for the same manifest.

Code smells to grep for on any bundled entry:

- a version-shaped string literal in a bundled entry (`version: '1.1.1'`)
- a `package.json` path reached at runtime by a package whose `files` list excludes it
- a package whose tsconfig extends a `tsc/*` preset while its build tool is a bundler
- a version assertion whose expected value comes from the artifact under test rather than from its source
