# attw, the arethetypeswrong CLI, built from this repository.
#
# The CLI is a self-contained program: tsdown inlines every runtime dependency
# (effect, @effect/platform-node, the engine, typescript) into one ESM file, so
# the result is Node plus a single .mjs and nothing else. pnpm exists only to
# put the build toolchain in place. Each lockfile package is fetched by its own
# integrity field, so the lockfile is the only pin — a lockfile bump does not
# need a second store-wide hash.
